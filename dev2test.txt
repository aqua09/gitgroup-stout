This file is being created on the 'dev' branch..
.. ready to roll into 'test'.

Rolled to 'test' branch successfully.

Keeping this in 'test' branch so that 'test' branch can advance along with
'master' branch.

However, at some point we'll want to roll 'test' into production. The 'master'
branch will be production.

Making update to this file on the test branch.. just wanting to advance this branch a little.

Advancing.. dev on remote so that my local branch will be behind.

Rebase example.. advancing.. past server/client branches.
 
Making a change.. testing git format-patch and git send-mail.
- can ~/.gitconfig for using git send-mail be configured to NOT store the imap password?
