gitgroup-stout
==============

The is a demonstration repo to be used as part of a Git study group.

In order to push changes to this repo, either..

1) I will need to add you as a contributor

 or

2) You can fork the project and then send pull request.

Both options make for a good exercise.

NOTES:

- I create a new branch 'breakme' .. this should be interesting!
