gitgroup-stout
==============

The is a demonstration repo to be used as part of a Git study group.

In order to push changes to this repo, either..

1) I will need to add you as a contributor

 or

2) You can fork the project and then send pull request.

Both options make for a good exercise.

NOTES:

- I created a new branch, 'breakme'. This should be interesting!
  Even though there is now a 'breakme' branch.. feel free to experiment on any branch :)

- GUI's can be nice and may integrate well into your workflow. However, I __highly recommend__
  having a Git Bash shell (Windows) or a Terminal shell (Mac) open to use along with the
  examples throughout the book.
